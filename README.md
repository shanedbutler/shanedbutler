### Hi there, I'm Shane! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer shifting from a 12-year photography career. As a student of the NewForce coding school I've collaborated in teams using version control (Git), building front-end SPAs (Javascript / React), and writing back-end services (C# / .NET). I have a passion for web applications, learning, and utilizing my skills to reach creative solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing and developing first projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to deploy projects using Docker
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on civic-tech projects, small games, or visual / design tools.
