### Hi there, I'm Shane! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who has shifted from a 12-year photography career. I've collaborated in teams using version control (Git & TFS), developed front-end SPAs (Javascript / React), wrote connecting back-end services (C# / .NET) and interfaced with databases (SQL Server) through ORMs (EF) and direct query. I have a passion for web applications, learning, and utilizing my skills to reach creative solutions.
